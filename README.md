Task 1: Construct a simple classifier to say whether a review is positive or negative by looking words up in a lexicon. The rest__
of my code is me changed the lexicon, but unknowingly overtraining it.__
Task 2: Construct a Naive Bayes classifier.__
Task 3: Ziph's law and Heaps' law.__
Task 4: Sign test on the two classifiers.__
Task 5: Cross-validation.__
Task 6: Fleiss' kappa.__

Task 7: Generating a Hidden Markov Model from a datastore which records the observed sequence and the hidden sequence.
Task 8: Using the Viterbi algorithm to create the most probable hidden sequence for an observed sequence.

Exercise 7 and 8 are the implementations on the hidden states loaded dice and fair dice, the observed sequences being the values of the dice roll.
Exercise 9 is an application in Biology

Task 10: Given a graph find its diameter.
